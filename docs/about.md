I am on a relentless pursuit to realize every drop of potential I have in the field of Mobile Development, precisely, Android.

It all started in my high school senior year with CS50, an online Computer Science course, which had an Android learning path.

After that, I continued to self-learn Android development by building applications for Android devices until I landed my first Android job position, all while studying Software Engineering at Vilnius University.

3 years of experience in Android development is a measurable way to reduce the story.

Outside of Android, Flutter is one of the tools that I am currently learning; iOS & KMM are on the learning list.

Besides development, I am highly enthusiastic about sharing knowledge & experience, primarily in the form of writing.
