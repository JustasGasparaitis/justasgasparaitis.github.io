I love JetBrains, I don't use any other IDEs anymore!

- I love Kotlin so much, it was announced as one of the most loved programming languages.
  I swear it's all me. Singlehandedly.

- I'm a 12-in-1 shampoo type of guy, that's why I like that they have an IDE for every platform.
  COBOL, Prolog, Java, C#, you name it, it's got it. (at least a plugin)

- I'm sure there's a plugin for every single thing in the world on their IDEs.
  Do you like Vim? There's a plugin for it.
  Do you like to put a giant Christmas tree as your background image? It's there.
  There are some really weird ones... (don't look up Rainbow Fart)

- Get bullied by your coworkers for your weird theme choice of pimping out your IDE.
  My theme is all dark red. It's called Material Volcano and it's so good, it's a fashion statement.
  I don't care, I'm never giving it up. Stop asking.

- I swear JetBrains makes me code rabbit fast.
  The key bindings are UNRIVALED, and for every single IDE variation, they're the same and fully customizable.

What's the IDE you love the most?
