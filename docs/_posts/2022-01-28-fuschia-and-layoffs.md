# Google's Infamous Fuchsia OS & Mass Layoffs

Google's built-from-scratch & open-source Fuchsia Operating System
might just be one of the company's most infamous projects.

Media outlets have been probing at Fuchsia OS becoming
'the Android replacer' ever since its UI was revealed.
([1](https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/08/google-fuchsia-os-matures/),

That didn't help make peoples'
expectations shy.
<!--end_excerpt-->
I've heard rumors and discussions
on Fuchsia becoming the third mobile OS, along with Android & iOS,
eventually replacing Android.

Actually, Fuchsia might have [its first hardware launch](https://9to5google.com/2023/01/10/google-fuchsia-launch-upcoming-device/)
with the Nest Hub Max - a smart home speaker.

All that considered, it seems that Fuchsia OS, quoting a Google engineer, is still
'an experimental project that is pivoting and morphing into ways of use'.

Having done more research about it, it seems that Fuchsia has
a long road to conquer and there are many obstacles to overcome...

##### In the wake of massive layoffs, **16 percent of its 400-person staff** took a hit.

Let me calm you down though,
it's not the catastrophe of the world,
not for the laid-off people,
and definitely not for Big Tech:
- [Survey:](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/blog/laid-off-tech-workers/)
About 8 out of 10 techies, who lose their job, find a new one within 3 months.
- [Factsheet](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/big-tech-revenue-profit-by-company/):
While growth has halted, most FAANG companies are still reaping massive profits
by their latest quarter statements
(_hard to sympathize, when they're sitting on mountains of cash anyway_).

But there is no doubt that it will stunt the ambition of Google's Fuchsia OS.

##### Google is known for starting and dropping ambitious projects.

Remember [Google Stadia](https://blog.google/products/stadia/message-on-stadia-streaming-strategy/)?

##### Google has released a whopping total of **four public statements** on Fuchsia OS in the span of 7 years.
Statements:
[1](https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/19/googles-dave-burke-first-rule-fuchsia-dont-talk-fuchsia/),
[2](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18563521/google-fuchsia-os-android-chrome-hiroshi-lockheimer-secrets-revealed),
[3](https://9to5google.com/2022/08/30/fuchsia-director-interview-chris-mckillop/),
[4](https://9to5google.com/2022/12/29/google-fuchsia-2023-development/)

The lack of public statements and excitement about the project
is worrying, as it means Fuchsia could fade away just as calmly
as it faded in with no announcements on GitHub in 2016.

Future could be more **fuchsia**-tinted for Google's Fuchsia OS
in the light of the mass layoffs, but I find myself rooting for it.

Anyway, here's the **fifth**  statement on layoffs and Fuchsia OS
from a recently laid-off Fuchsia engineer:
