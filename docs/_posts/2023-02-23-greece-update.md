I am ecstatic to start the third to last semester of my Software Engineering studies in Athens.

<!--end_excerpt-->

I am only able to do this because of the amazing Erasmus+ programme.

I am extra grateful to have the opportunity to both work (shoutout to TeleSoftas) and study at the same time, even when
being abroad.

The Greek views & weather are breathtaking -- what a stark contrast to 5 hours a month of sun in Vilnius. :D

Here I am on the peak of Lycabettus Hill in the heart of the beautiful city of Athens.

I have also become addicted to souvlaki. Please send help.
